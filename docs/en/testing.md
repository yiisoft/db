# Testing

This package can be tested globally or individually for each DBMS.

- [MSSQL](https://github.com/yiisoft/db-mssql)
- [MySQL/MariaDB](https://github.com/yiisoft/db-mysql)
- [Oracle](https://github.com/yiisoft/db-oracle)
- [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/yiisoft/db-pgsql)
- [SQLite](https://github.com/yiisoft/db-sqlite)

## Docker images

For greater ease it is recommended to use Docker containers for each DBMS, for this you can use the [docker-compose.yml](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) file that in the root directory of each package.

- [MSSQL 2022](https://github.com/yiisoft/db-mssql/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
- [MySQL 8](https://github.com/yiisoft/db-mysql/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
- [MariaDB 10.11](https://github.com/yiisoft/db-mysql/blob/master/docker-compose-mariadb.yml)
- [Oracle 21](https://github.com/yiisoft/db-oracle/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
- [PostgreSQL 15](https://github.com/yiisoft/db-pgsql/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

For running the Docker containers you can use the following command:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

## Unit testing

The package is tested with [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/).

### Global testing

To test all dbms at once, you can use the [docker-compose.yml](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) file that in the root directory of each package.

The following steps are required to run the tests:

1. Run all Docker containers for each dbms.
2. Install the dependencies of the project with composer.
3. Run the tests.

```shell
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

### Individual testing

To test each dbms individually, you can use the [docker-compose.yml](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) file that in the root directory of each package.

The following steps are required to run the tests:

1. Run the Docker container for the dbms you want to test.
2. Install the dependencies of the project with composer.
3. Run the tests.

```shell
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=Pgsql
```

Suites available:
- Mssql
- Mysql
- Oracle
- Pgsql
- Sqlite

## Static analysis

The code is statically analyzed with [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/). To run static analysis:

```shell
./vendor/bin/psalm
```

## Rector

Use [Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) to make codebase follow some specific rules or use either newest or any specific version of PHP: 

```shell
./vendor/bin/rector
```

## Composer require checker

This package uses [composer-require-checker](https://github.com/maglnet/ComposerRequireChecker) to check if all dependencies are correctly defined in `composer.json`.

To run the checker, execute the following command:

```shell
./vendor/bin/composer-require-checker
```
