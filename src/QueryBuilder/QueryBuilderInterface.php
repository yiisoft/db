     * Converts an abstract column type into a physical column type.
     *
     * The conversion is done using the type map specified in {@see typeMap}.
     * The following abstract column types are supported (using MySQL as an example to explain the corresponding
     * physical types):
     *
     * - `pk`: an auto-incremental primary key type, will be converted into "int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY
     *    KEY"
     * - `bigpk`: an auto incremental primary key type, will be converted into "bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
     *    PRIMARY KEY"
     * - `upk`: an unsigned auto incremental primary key type, will be converted into "int(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL
     *    AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY"
     * - `char`: char type, will be converted into "char(1)"
     * - `string`: string type, will be converted into "varchar(255)"
     * - `text`: a long string type, will be converted into "text"
     * - `smallint`: a small integer type, will be converted into "smallint(6)"
     * - `integer`: integer type, will be converted into "int(11)"
     * - `bigint`: a big integer type, will be converted into "bigint(20)"
     * - `boolean`: boolean type, will be converted into "tinyint(1)"
     * - `float``: float number type, will be converted into "float"
     * - `decimal`: decimal number type, will be converted into "decimal"
     * - `datetime`: datetime type, will be converted into "datetime"
     * - `timestamp`: timestamp type, will be converted into "timestamp"
     * - `time`: time type, will be converted into "time"
     * - `date`: date type, will be converted into "date"
     * - `money`: money type, will be converted into "decimal(19,4)"
     * - `binary`: binary data type, will be converted into "blob"
     *
     * If the abstract type has two or more parts separated by spaces (such as "string NOT NULL"), then only the first
     * part will be converted, and the rest of the parts will be appended to the converted result.
     *
     * For example, 'string NOT NULL' is converted to 'varchar(255) NOT NULL'.
     *
     * For some abstract types, you can also specify a length or precision constraint by appending it in round brackets
     * directly to the type.
     *
     * For example, `string(32)` will be converted into "varchar(32)" on a MySQL database.
     * If the underlying DBMS doesn't support these kinds of constraints for a type, it will be ignored.
     *
     * If a type can't be found in {@see typeMap}, it will be returned without any change.

     * @param ColumnInterface|string $type Abstract column type.
     *
     * @return string Physical column type.
