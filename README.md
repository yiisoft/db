</p>

Yii Database Library is a database extension for the [Yii Framework]
that provides a set of database utilities and a database-agnostic, [ActiveRecord] implementation 
for working with databases in Yii applications.

The package has a number of classes that you can use to connect to and query different types of databases,
such as [MariaDB], [MSSQL], [MySQL], [Oracle], [PostgreSQL], and [SQLite].
It also provides an [ActiveRecord] implementation to interact with database tables using objects,
similar to the way you would use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks like Doctrine or Hibernate.

Using the Yii Database Library, you can perform common database tasks such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting
records in a database table, as well as executing raw SQL queries.
The package is designed to be flexible
and can be extended to support extra database types or to customize the way it interacts with databases.

It's used in [Yii Framework], but you can use it as a standalone library.
